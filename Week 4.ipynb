Germany, where the city is situated, is not well known for vegetarian food. In the contrary, typical German dishes include a lot of meat. So, for tourists who prefer to eat vegetarian for reasons such as religion, health and others, finding the right spot to eat in Cologne can be difficult and frustrating. \n\nThus, the problem I want to solve is to give a simple recommendation to tourists in Cologne: in which district of the city will you find the highest number of vegetarian restaurants? The **target audience** are foreign tourists looking for an area in which to eat vegetarian food."

I will use these districts and the data about restaurants in these districts from foursquare to show the density of vegetarian restaurants in them. "
